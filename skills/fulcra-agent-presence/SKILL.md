# Fulcra Agent Presence

## Installation

This skill uses the `coord-engine` CLI — a small, stdlib-only tool that runs the deterministic folds. Install it once:

```bash
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/ashfulcra/fulcra-tools@coord-engine-v1.3.0#subdirectory=packages/coord-engine"
```

After installation, `coord-engine <command>` is on your PATH.

Enhances [`fulcra-agent-teams`](https://github.com/fulcradynamics/agent-skills). Teams knows who its
*members* are (prose in `index.md`) but not who is **alive right now**. This skill adds a presence
heartbeat + deterministic liveness folds — the roster that directives' broadcast semantics, the operator
digest, and role-vacancy escalation all build on. Optional: without it, everything else still works;
broadcasts just degrade to "acked-by-me hides it for me".

## How it works
- **Beat** (single-file write, safe as a command): `presence beat` writes/refreshes your shard
  `team/<team>/presence/<agent-key>.md` (collision-safe key) (OKF `type: Presence`: agent, workstreams, summary, timestamp).
  Beat whenever you start work, on heartbeat/cron ticks, and when your focus changes.
- **Folds** (deterministic, engine-side — never eyeball timestamps):
  - `presence show` — roster with `live` (<1h) / `idle` (<24h) / `stale` per agent.
  - `agents` — cross-agent digest: each agent's liveness, summary, and open work by status
    (union of presence ∪ task owners/assignees from the reconcile aggregate).
  - Roles: `roles claim <team> <role>` writes/refreshes your lease shard; `roles release` deletes it;
    `roles status` folds HELD/VACANT/CONTESTED (see fulcra-agent-roles).

## Usage
```bash
coord-engine presence beat <team> [--agent X] [-w workstream]... [-s "one-liner"]
coord-engine presence show <team> [--json]
coord-engine agents <team> [--json]
coord-engine roles claim <team> <role> [--agent X]     # refresh = re-run
coord-engine roles release <team> <role> [--agent X]
```
`--agent` defaults to `$FULCRA_COORD_AGENT` (or a derived host id). Stale shards drop out of the
presence fold's `[live]` view by age; the shard FILES are not currently garbage-collected (reconcile's
GC covers ack and health shards only). A stale agent reappears by simply beating again.

## Pick your identity by ROLE, not by folder

Set `FULCRA_COORD_AGENT` to the role you are acting as (`coord-maintainer`, `prefs-maintainer`,
`release-reviewer`), not a host/cwd-derived string. Folder-derived ids collide the moment two sessions
share a directory (shared inbox, clobbered presence, ambiguous acks) and rot when a hostname or checkout
path changes; a role-based id survives both and is what teammates actually want to address. Two rules
make it safe:

1. **Claim the role's lease while you act as it** (`roles claim <team> <role>`; see
   fulcra-agent-roles). An `exclusive` role turns two sessions acting as the same role under
   DIFFERENT ids into a visible CONTESTED state. It cannot see two sessions sharing one id string
   (same lease shard, last write wins) — see the roles skill's "Role-as-identity" guard matrix for
   the procedural check that covers that case.
2. **Session/host details are metadata, not address.** Put them in the presence `-s` summary or the
   lease body if useful; never in the agent id.

The derived host id remains only as a fallback for throwaway/anonymous sessions that never take
assignments — and note it is per-HOST, not per-session (`coord-reconcile:<hostname>`), so two env-less
sessions on one machine still share an id and clobber each other's shards. Any session that acts on the
bus should set an explicit role id.
