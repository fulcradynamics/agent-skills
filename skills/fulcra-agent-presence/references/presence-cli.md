# Fulcra Agent Presence — CLI reference

```bash
coord-engine presence beat <team> [--agent X] [-w ws]... [-s TEXT]  # write/refresh presence/<agent>.md
coord-engine presence show <team> [--json]                          # roster: live/idle/stale
coord-engine agents <team> [--json]                                 # liveness + open work per agent
coord-engine roles claim   <team> <role> [--agent X]                # lease shard write/refresh
coord-engine roles release <team> <role> [--agent X]                # lease shard delete
```
