# Fulcra Agent Health

## Installation

This skill uses the `coord-engine` CLI — a small, stdlib-only tool that runs the deterministic folds. Install it once:

```bash
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/ashfulcra/fulcra-tools@coord-engine-v1.3.0#subdirectory=packages/coord-engine"
```

After installation, `coord-engine <command>` is on your PATH.

Enhances [`fulcra-agent-teams`](https://github.com/fulcradynamics/agent-skills). When a team is healed by
scheduled reconciles across several machines, the operational questions are *"is anything actually
running?"* and *"which host went dark?"* — this skill answers them deterministically. (The digest +
role-escalation sweep land here too — A5b.)

## How it works
- Every `coord-engine reconcile` writes a small **health shard**
  (`_coord/health/<host-key>.json`: host, timestamp, engine version, task count, warnings) and prunes
  shards older than 30 days (age-based GC).
- **`coord-engine health <team>`** folds the shards: per-host last-reconcile age, STALE flag (>24h),
  engine version — exits non-zero when no host is fresh (usable as a monitor probe).
- **`coord-engine doctor [team]`** is the local preflight: storage CLI on PATH, File Store reachable,
  engine version. Run it after install and inside scheduled jobs' self-tests (the parent project's
  heartbeats failed silently on exactly these).

## Operator digest (A5b)
`coord-engine digest <team>` folds the aggregate + presence into the four operator questions:
**blocked on you** (`needs:human` tags / tasks assigned to your handle — env `FULCRA_COORD_HUMAN`),
**upcoming** (`not_before` within 7 days), **agents** (liveness + open work each), and **stale**
(active tasks untouched > 48h). `--store` persists it to `_coord/digests/<date>-<window>.md`, deduped
per day+window (morning/evening) — heartbeat-safe. *Timeline annotation is deferred until the
record-write CLI surface is verified — the incumbent's racy check-then-create minted duplicate data
types (operator bug), and we won't repeat that.*

## Role-vacancy escalation (A5b)
`coord-engine escalate <team>` sweeps every role doc: if a role is VACANT past its `sla_hours` and
today's marker doesn't exist, it writes the marker and files a **P1 directive to the role's
`maintainer`** ("claim it or reassign"). Idempotent per day; run it from the heartbeat.

## Usage
```bash
coord-engine doctor <team>          # preflight; exit 0 = healthy
coord-engine health <team> [--json] # fleet fold; exit 1 if no fresh reconciler
coord-engine digest <team> [--human H] [--json] [--store]
coord-engine escalate <team>        # vacancy sweep (heartbeat-safe)
```

## When to use
- After installing the skills on a new machine (doctor).
- In monitoring/heartbeat wrappers (health --json; alert on `healthy: false`).
- Diagnosing "the index looks stale" — health shows which reconciler stopped.
